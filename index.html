                    We have all been there – feeling under the weather but not knowing what’s wrong. It could be the food we’re eating, the air we breathe, or even gut health. Since the stomach is the second largest organ in your body after your brain, its functioning affects your overall health. If your <a style="color: #cc5da9;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract">gut</a>  is not working correctly, you will remain tired and deprived of energy for routine work. IV therapy is one of the most effective therapies to boost your gut repair process. But before making any decision, it is essential to understand what IV therapy is and how it can help improve your health.

                    It is the balance of good and bad bacteria in the gut. A good balance keeps the stomach healthy, promotes digestion, and helps the immune system function. To improve your bowels naturally, you can make healthy lifestyle choices, such as eating a balanced diet and engaging in physical activity. You can also consider taking dietary supplements or using antibiotics to improve your gut microbiome balance which several factors, including poor diet, stress, and smoking, can damage. You can also try IV therapy or gut repair to improve overall body health and function.

                    Factors that can affect gut health.

                <p>
                        <b>1. Diet</b><br>

                        Eating a healthy, balanced diet is the most critical factor. A healthy diet includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, as these foods provide nutrients and antioxidants that protect the gut from inflammation and damage. Additionally, avoiding processed food is essential to maintaining bowels health as these foods are high in sugar, sodium, and saturated fat. <br>

                        <b>2. Infections</b><br>

                        Avoiding infections is one of the critical factors in preventing damage. Some conditions can cause stomach inflammation, leading to leaky gut symptoms. These symptoms, such as nausea or diarrhea, occur when immune cells slip through the gut barrier and into the body, allowing harmful substances to enter the bloodstream. <br>

                        <b>3. Chemicals</b><br>
                    <p>
                        Excess exposure to chemicals such as pesticides and antibiotics can damage your gut health by causing inflammation or altering the structure of the lining of the digestive tract. When this happens, food particles may not be adequately absorbed into the body or may be damaged beyond recognition, leading to inflammation or other issues.<br>
            
                       <b> 4. Genetics</b><br>

                        Genes play an essential role in developing leaky gut symptoms. Some people are predisposed to leaky guts because of their genes or environmental exposures.

                        IV therapy, or intravenous therapy, is a medical treatment in which fluids, medications, or blood products are delivered directly into a patient’s bloodstream through an intravenous (IV) line. An IV line is a small tube inserted into a vein, typically in the arm or hand, and held in place with a small adhesive dressing or tape. IV therapy can be used to administer various fluids and medications, including saline solution, electrolytes, and pain medications. It is often used in hospitals and other healthcare settings to rehydrate patients, administer medications, or provide nutrients. IV therapy can also be used in the outpatient setting, such as in a clinic or home, for patients who require ongoing treatment.
